Data Collection

- Fs: 22,050 sampling rate for data
- nBits: 16bit samples
- nChannels: 1

- 1 to 2 frames before word to capture onset\


- set frequencies range
- test 10%

- run for more epochs




1) Write your alignment code in Python.
2) Do the test we discussed to see if the aligner performs as expected.
3) Do you have more data recording planned?
4) is modify your recording protocol to use automatic alignment.
4.5) Rename the files so there are leading 0's. Moidify naming system in code too
5) new experiment!! load + save weights in pytorch
6) run whole sound file through model
7) *andrew afs website hosting


8) add new class to model (4th class being the non of the above option)
9) look into how to spectrogram from wav via javascript
10) look into webpage
